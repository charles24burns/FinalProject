  We used the data set of Colleges to compare the difference between The Median Earnings 8 years after entry and the Average cost of tuition. 
  Once you click on a certain dot from the scatter plot, you will see the Name, Region, Locale, Admission rate, Average Cost, and Median Earnings 8 years after entry. 
  The Dropbox feature allows the user to look at universities in a specific locale if they are looking for a college that would be best for their location.
  It also highlights the difference between Private and Public Schools which gives further insight into the numbers listed on the graph.
